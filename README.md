# A Statechart Template Library for IoT System Modelling

A library of statechart templates for designing IoT systems. We have developed
atomic statechart components modelling the heterogeneous aspects of IoT systems including sensors, ac-
tuators, network, and controller. Base system units for smart systems, such as smart light and smart fire
alarm, have also been designed. A component for calculating power usage is available in the library. Ad-
ditionally, a smart hub template that controls interactions among multiple IoT systems and manages power
consumption has also been proposed. The templates aim to facilitate the development of IoT systems. Our
work is demonstrated with a smart home system consisting of a smart light, a smart microwave, a smart
TV, and a smart fire alarm system. We have created a multi statechart with Yakindu based on the proposed
templates and components. A smart home simulator has been developed by generating controller code from
the statechart and integrating it with a user interface.
